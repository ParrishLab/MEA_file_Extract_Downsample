# MEA_file_Extract_Downsample
This code takes .brw files from MEA recordings and downsamples them both spatially and temporally.

Instructions:

1) Run ChannelExtract.py on your .brw file(s) first to select the channels, sampling rate, and time region to export.
2) Use the export_to_brw.py on the output file of ChannelExtract.py to create the downsampled data files.
